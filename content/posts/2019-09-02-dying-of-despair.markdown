In this digital age, it is far too easy to become self-absorbed by work. This new plague has consumed many lives. These aptly named "deaths of despair" are described in detail by associate professor of psychiatry and director of the Medical Ethics Program at UC Irvine School of Medicine, Dr. Aaron Kheriaty, in his August 2017 article, "Dying of Despair." In it, Kheriaty talks about the nation's growing depression epidemic, its causes, its dire consequences, and how it can be avoided.  







### The Suicide Epidemic in Numbers 







At first glance, it may not seem like America is experiencing record high depression and suicidal rates, but to shine light onto this subject, Kheriaty is quick to present statistical evidence. A statewide census reported that about 17% of high school students in America experience depression.  In a single school year, Los Anges Unified School District reported over five thousand incidents of suicidal behavior. As a result of these rising tendencies, for the first time since the 1930s, U.S. life expectancy rates have fallen. The WHO has declared depression the leading cause of disability at a worldwide scale. Because of all of this, suicide is now the second leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults, and tenth overall in America. 







### The Cause 







Depression, suicide, and drug abuse have a root cause in increasing social fragmentation. In other words, loneliness is the real silent killer. So much so, that the surgeon general announced social isolation to be a major health crisis alongside heart disease and cancer. Economic factors while contributing are not limiting to explaining the causes of rising suicide rates. Instead, the rise of suicide rates is more closely attributed to the quality of family connections, spiritual fulfillment, and each person's unique meaning and satisfaction in life. Sociologists see these attributes manifested in fewer marriages and declining piety. America has experienced cultural changes combined with weakening social connections to friends, family, and neighbors. Instead of finding an identity with a strong sense of purpose, many Americans experience social angst as universal binding truths decay away. 







### The Consequences 







Loneliness is a disease that may lead to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, violence, and premature death. In short, not solving the depression crisis will only foment a host of health risks that result in decreasing life expectancy.  







### A New Hope







The cure to loneliness and depression is quite unexpected. Kheriaty cites medical studies were subjects improved their depression through "prayer, religious faith, participation in a religious community, and practices like cultivating gratitude, [and] forgiveness." This may come to no surprise to some, it seems like the Golden Rule if applied abundantly would remedy this crisis. For several, this may mean a return to church. Most importantly, one must never lose hope. In a world where success is measured by one's utility to society, it is important to spread hope. As in Star Wars, there must be a balance between light and dark, and currently, the world is submerged in darkness. So, to end this depression crisis spread positivity for not only is it as contagious as negativity but it is also its only natural nemesis.
