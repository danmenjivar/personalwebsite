## La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Lip Balm

It’s officially winter which means dry lips for me. I’ve tried my fair share of Chapstick, Burt’s Bees, Aquaphor, you name it. But this, IMHO, is the best. A little pricey for lip balm but the difference this makes in my everyday life makes it worth it.

## PLUR1BUS 

Vince Gilligan is at it again, frankly I have no clue where this story will go, which is precisely why I am glued to my TV every Friday. Bravo. 

## New Nintendo 3DS XL

Yes, this is favorites for December 2025. You are not reading this wrong. So why 3DS now? 

Well, if you know me, 2026 is the year I got into retro emulation handhelds. Earlier this year I picked up a Retroid Pocket 5 (RP5) and later a TrimUI Brick.  Between these 2 devices, I can emulate all of Atari, Arcade, Genesis, Dreamcast, NES, SNES, GB, GBC, GBA, N64, Game Cube, PS1, PSP, and even PS2.

The RP5 is more than capable of emulating DS and 3DS, Retroid even put out an accessory second screen, and there’s shiny new dual screen devices like the AYN Thor, but when it comes to DS and 3DS, you can’t beat the original hardware.

I’ve had a blast playing through Super Mario 3D Land, and hope to start on Zelda: A Link Between World soon.

## Bevel Fitness

I’ve been trying to take better care of my health, which has meant wearing my Apple Watch to bed. Turns out, I sleep horribly. My nutrition is also not ideal. Bevel an app that is a nutrition tracker, sleep tracker, workout tracker all rolled into one went free recently. I’ve been testing out the 2 free week trial of their ai features. But ai or not, I think I’ll use this to track my health this coming year. 

## Project Hail Mary
This has been on my reading list for a while. Happy I finally got around to it. Amazing story, I’m looking forward to the movie starring Ryan Gosling next year.

Well that’s my monthly round up. Not sure if I will do this again next month, but I am going to spend time next year updating this site. I may need to rebuild it using the latest version of Hugo. Just to make this post was a challenge. Also I like the idea of sharing what I am working on outside of any social media. So hopefully I get to do more of this next year.
